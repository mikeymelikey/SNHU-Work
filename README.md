Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was about returning a list of words alongside their frequencies in the text given. It solves the problem of having to scroll through the whole text to find the frequency yourself.
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did particularly well with opening files and looping through them in the python file. The reason being that I have experience doing this exact thing for a personal project where I looped through a text file and had dictionary definitions automatically pulled from a website for a list of words.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance this code by having the second function call the first function and passing the result of the first function to the second function, within the python code. This could enhance code readability and also shorten the code.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I had the most trouble with the part in the C++ code that involved calling the python functions. Every time I tried to call the function within the switch statement, I kept getting an error. I ended up solving this by putting that particular case within brackets, which was a suggested solution online to the same error.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I feel that the most transferable skill I learned with this project is related to the combination of easy code in C++ with code that would be hard in C++, but is easy in python. This hypothetically makes the code more efficient as generally C++ is more efficient, but only if you actually know how to write something correctly. If python is great for a task, but I want to use C++, then I could combine the two by calling on python for the thing python is better with, for example, file handling or automation.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure the code was maintable, readable, and adaptable, by adding comments to every line, so that anyone, including myself, could go back in a look at this code. They could read the code like a book and make any changes easily.
